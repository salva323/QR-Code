## My process
This is the first time I complete a challge on Frontendmentor. 

I built a similar project on freecodeacademy so I did my best to replicate it and experiment with easy concepts 
like 'padding' and 'margins'

### Built with

- Visual Studio Code
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- 
### What I learned

The first time I tried this challenge I was lost and gave up after 10 minutes. I did some YouTube watching which helped me learn that anything inside a div container stays inside of it. I learned how to center a div container and how to link Google fonts into my code.
